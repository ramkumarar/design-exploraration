Of course. Here is a comprehensive list of the most common and useful Kafka metrics for both consumers and producers, as they typically appear in Prometheus when collected via the **JMX Exporter**.

The exact metric names you see can vary slightly based on the JMX Exporter's configuration file (`config.yaml`), but these are the standard, community-accepted names.

### Kafka Consumer Metrics (`kafka_consumer_*`)

These metrics give you insight into the health, performance, and progress of your consumer applications. They are typically exposed from the `consumer-fetch-manager-metrics`, `consumer-coordinator-metrics`, and `consumer-metrics` JMX MBean groups.

#### **Critical Health & Lag Metrics**
These are the most important metrics to monitor and alert on.

| Metric Name                               | Description                                                                                                                              | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kafka_consumer_records_lag_max`          | The maximum lag in terms of the number of records for any partition assigned to this consumer. A single value per consumer client.         | **Alert on this!** This is the single best indicator of a consumer falling behind. If this value grows, your consumer is not keeping up. |
| `kafka_consumer_records_lag`              | The per-partition lag for this consumer. You will have one of these for each partition assigned to the consumer.                           | **Drill-down for debugging.** If `records_lag_max` is high, use this metric (filtered by partition) to find the specific "stuck" partition. |
| `kafka_consumer_last_heartbeat_seconds_ago` | The time in seconds since this consumer sent its last heartbeat to the group coordinator.                                                | **Alert on this!** A high value (e.g., > 30s) means the consumer is likely stalled, in a GC pause, or "zombied" and about to be kicked from the group. |
| `kafka_consumer_failed_rebalances_total`  | The total number of failed rebalances. (Note: This might be named `rebalance_failed_total` in some older configs).                          | High numbers indicate persistent problems with the consumer group, such as session timeouts or application bugs during rebalance. |

#### **Throughput & Rate Metrics**

| Metric Name                              | Description                                                                   | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kafka_consumer_records_consumed_rate`   | The average number of records consumed per second.                            | Measures the processing throughput of your consumer. Helps in capacity planning.               |
| `kafka_consumer_bytes_consumed_rate`     | The average number of bytes consumed per second.                              | Measures the network throughput of your consumer.                                                |
| `kafka_consumer_fetch_rate`              | The rate of fetch requests sent to the brokers.                               | A very low rate might indicate an idle consumer or a consumer that is processing very slowly.   |
| `kafka_consumer_commit_rate`             | The rate of offset commits to the brokers.                                    | Tracks how often the consumer is saving its progress.                                            |

#### **Latency & Performance Metrics**

| Metric Name                               | Description                                                                    | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kafka_consumer_fetch_latency_avg`        | The average time taken for a fetch request to be fulfilled by the broker.        | High latency indicates slow brokers or network issues between your consumer and the cluster.                                   |
| `kafka_consumer_fetch_latency_max`        | The maximum time taken for a fetch request.                                    | Catches outliers. A spike in max latency can help diagnose intermittent network or broker problems.                            |
| `kafka_consumer_commit_latency_avg`       | The average time taken for an offset commit request.                           | High latency can slow down processing if your application logic waits for commits to complete.                               |
| `kafka_consumer_heartbeat_response_time_max` | The maximum time taken for a heartbeat to be acknowledged by the coordinator.  | A spike here can be an early warning of network or broker-side (coordinator) issues before `last_heartbeat_seconds_ago` gets high. |
| `kafka_consumer_join_time_avg`            | The average time taken for the consumer to join the group during a rebalance.  | High join times can indicate slow rebalances across the entire group.                                                          |

### Kafka Producer Metrics (`kafka_producer_*`)

These metrics give you insight into the performance, efficiency, and error rates of your producer applications. They are typically exposed from the `producer-metrics` and `producer-topic-metrics` JMX MBean groups.

#### **Critical Health & Error Metrics**

| Metric Name                        | Description                                                                 | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kafka_producer_record_error_rate` | The average rate of records per second that failed to be sent permanently.  | **Alert on this!** Any non-zero value indicates data loss. These are un-retryable errors (e.g., message too large, invalid topic). |
| `kafka_producer_record_retry_rate` | The average rate of records per second that were retried before succeeding. | **Alert on this!** A high rate indicates transient cluster instability (e.g., leader elections, network blips). The producer is recovering, but performance is degraded. |
| `kafka_producer_request_latency_max` | The maximum time taken for a produce request to the broker.                 | Catches outliers. High values can point to a slow broker partition or network issues and can cause producer-side buffering.     |

#### **Throughput & Rate Metrics**

| Metric Name                        | Description                                              | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kafka_producer_record_send_rate`  | The average number of records sent per second.           | Measures the producer's write throughput in terms of message count.    |
| `kafka_producer_byte_rate`         | The average number of bytes sent per second.             | Measures the producer's network write throughput.                      |
| `kafka_producer_request_rate`      | The average rate of produce requests sent to the brokers.  | A measure of how often the producer sends batches of data.               |

#### **Efficiency & Performance Metrics**

| Metric Name                               | Description                                                                                                   | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kafka_producer_batch_size_avg`           | The average number of bytes in a producer batch sent to a broker.                                             | **Key tuning metric.** A low value means inefficient, small batches. Tune `linger.ms` and `batch.size` to increase this for better throughput.                  |
| `kafka_producer_batch_size_max`           | The maximum number of bytes in a producer batch.                                                              | Compare this to your `batch.size` config. If it's always hitting the max, your producer might be bottlenecked by this setting.                                |
| `kafka_producer_records_per_request_avg`  | The average number of records contained in each produce request (batch).                                      | Another key tuning metric. Higher is generally better for throughput.                                                                                            |
| `kafka_producer_compression_rate_avg`     | The average compression ratio of batches. A value of 5 means the data was compressed to 1/5th of its original size. | Helps you understand the effectiveness of your chosen compression codec (`gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`). A low ratio might suggest a different codec is needed. |
| `kafka_producer_request_latency_avg`      | The average time taken for a produce request.                                                                 | A baseline for producer performance. Watch for trends and deviations.                                                                                            |

#### **Connection Metrics**

| Metric Name                          | Description                                         | Why it's Important / How to Use It                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kafka_producer_connection_count`    | The current number of active connections to brokers.  | A stable number is normal. High churn (see below) or a very low number can indicate connection issues. |
| `kafka_producer_connection_creation_rate` | The rate of new connections being established.      | A sudden spike indicates the producer is frequently reconnecting, pointing to network instability. |
| `kafka_producer_connection_close_rate`    | The rate at which connections are being closed.     | A high rate indicates connection churn, which is inefficient and often a symptom of network problems. |
